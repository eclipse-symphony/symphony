# Staging provider

Staging provider allows [components](../concepts/unified-object-model/solution.md#componentspec) to be recorded on an [Target](../concepts/unified-object-model/target.md) object without being deployed to the actual target. This allows components to be **staged** and retrieved later, such as by a polling agent. 

## Provider configuration

| Field | Comment |
|--------|--------|
| `configType` | Type of K8s configuration, either `path` or `bytes`. |
| `configData` | Configuration data<sup>2</sup> |
| `inCluster` | If provider is running inside a K8s cluster (`"true"`). If `true`, `configType` and `configData` are not used. |
| `singleSolution` | If only one solution can be staged on the target. Default is `true`<sup>3</sup>. |
| `targetName` | Name of the target |

1: When `configType` is set to `path`, this property contains the path to a Kubernetes configuration file. If this property is left empty or omitted, the default Kubernetes configuration file on the host will be used. If `configType` is set to `bytes`, this property contains the Kubernetes configuration bytes, as shown in the following Target spec:

```yaml
topologies:
- bindings:
  - role: instance
    provider: providers.target.staging
    config:
      inCluster: "false"
      configType: "bytes"
      configData: |
        apiVersion: v1
        clusters:
        - cluster:
          certificate-authority-data: ...
          server: https://k8s-dns-7c476efd.hcp.westus3.azmk8s.io:443
        name: k8s
      contexts:
      - context:
          cluster: k8s
          user: clusterUser_symphony_k8s
        name: k8s
      current-context: k8s
      kind: Config
      preferences: {}
      users:
      - name: clusterUser_symphony_k8s
        user:
          client-certificate-data: ...
          client-key-data: ...
          token: ...
```

2: When `singleSolution` is set to `true`, staging a new solution to a target wipes all previously stated components. Otherwise, components from the solution are merged into the currently staged component list.
