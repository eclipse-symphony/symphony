# Sideload apps provider for Windows 10 and XBOX

This provider installs Windows apps through [sideloading](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/application-management/sideload-apps-in-windows-10).

## Component property mappings

This provider installs your application package (`.appxbundle`), registered as a **ComponentSpec**, to a target machine.

**ComponentSpec** properties are mapped as the following:

| ComponentSpec Properties | Win 10 Sideload Provider |
|--------|--------|
| `name`| This should match with your application package name|
| `app.package.path`| Path to the `.appxbundle` file. This path should be accessible from the provider, such as a Win 10 sideload provider hosted on a Windows-based Symphony agent.|

## Provider configuration

| Field | Comment |
|--------|--------|
| `IPAddress` | IP address of the target Windows 10 machine |
| `Pin` | Pairing pin<sup>2</sup>|
| `WinAppDeployCmdPath` | Full path to `WinAppDeployCmd.exe`<sup>1</sup>|

1: You can install `WinAppDeployCmd.exe` through [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/). You need at least version 1803.

2: Although in theory you can put the pairing pin (see [target configuration](#target-configuration)) in your provider configuration, since this is a one-time pin, you probably want to go through the pairing process once and omit this setting in your configuration.

## Target configuration

Before you can use sideloading to install apps on your Windows 10 client devices, you need to configure your target devices:

* Enable [developer mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development).
* When developer mode is enabled, also enable the **Device Discovery** feature.

### Pair your agent machine and your target machine

1. On your target machine, under the **Device Discovery** developer feature, select the **Pair** button to display the paring pin.
2. From the machine where you plan to run your Windows-based Symphony agent, run the following command:

   ```cmd
   WinAppDeployCmd list -ip <target machine IP> -pin <pairing pin>
   ```

   This command lists all installed application packages on your target machine. This also remembers the pairing pin so that you don't need the pairing pin any more.

<!--
### Configure the Windows-based Symphony agent

Follow instructions here to configure your agent: [Windows-based Symphony agent](../build_deployment/windows_agent.md). 
-->

### Import application signing certificate

You also need to import the application signing certificate. Please contact your application vendor.

## Create Symphony target

Because Symphony control plane usually runs on a Linux-based Kubernetes cluster, it uses a proxy provider to talk to the Windows-based Symphony agent you just configured. For more information, see [HTTP proxy provider](./http_proxy_provider.md) or [MQTT proxy provider](./mqtt_proxy_provider.md)
