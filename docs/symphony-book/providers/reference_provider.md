# Reference provider

A reference provider resolves an object reference to the actual object spec. For example, you can use a Kubernetes reference project to query a `solution` object by name, or list `targets` by a label selector or a field selector.

Symphony API uses a reference manager to resolve references. The reference manager has a built-in cache so that it doesn't repeatedly query the underlying system. The lifespan of cached items is controlled by the `cacheLifespan` setting, which is in seconds.

The following table summarizes how query parameters are interpreted by different providers:

| Parameter | HTTP provider | K8s provider | Custom Vision provider|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `field-selector`| field selector | field selector | - |
| `group` | object group | object group | model platform |
| `id` | object id | object id | Custom Vision project |
| `label-selector` | label selector | label selector | - |
| `kind` | object kind | object kind | model flavor |
| `ref` | v1alpha2.ReferenceHTTP | v1alpha2.ReferenceK8sCRD| v1alpha2.CustomVision |
| `scope` | object namespace | object namespace | Custom Vision endpoint|
| `version` | object version | object version | model iteration |
