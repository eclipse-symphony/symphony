# Debug Symphony API Locally

## Leverage Unit Tests

The best way to test a specific Symphony API component is to write/use unit test cases in the project to test the component in isolation. With VS Code extensions like [Code Debugger]( https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wowbox.code-debuger), you can set up break point and trace through the code, as shown in the following screenshot:

> **NOTE**: If you use VS Code with a WSL folder, please make sure you have the [WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) installed.

## Use Postman

Symphony exposes a REST API, which you can call using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). 
1. Build and launch Symphony API as a local process:
   ```bash
   # folder: symphony/api
   go build -o symphon-api
    ./symphony-api -c ./symphony-api-no-k8s.json -l Debug
    ```
2. Use Postman to send API calls to ```http://localhost:8080/v1alpha2```. See [Sample Requests](#sample-requests) for examples of API requests.
3. Add temporary log statements to trace what's happenin, rebuild and re-launch and use the console to observe logs.

## Sample Requests
1. Deploy a Redis server as a new ```Instance```.

   > **NOTE**: This request assumes your ```kubectl``` is configured to use your target K8s cluster as the default context. If you want to use a different cluster, either update your ```kubectl``` settings to use the new cluster as the default context (using ```kubectl config use-context <context-name>```), or you'll need to modify the Symphony API configuration file (like ```symphony-api-dev.json```) and update the corresponding target provider settings.

   * Method: POST
   * Path: http://localhost:8080/v1alpha2/solution/instances|
   * Body

        ```json

            },

                "name": "my-solution",
                "components": [

                    }
                ]
            },
            "targets": {
                "my-k8s": {
                    "topologies": [
                        {

                                {
                                    "role": "instance",
                                    "provider": "providers.target.k8s",

                                    }
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "assignments": {
                "my-k8s": "{redis-server}"
            },

            "componentEndIndex": 0                
        }

2. Delete the above Instance:

    * Method: DELETE
    * Path: http://localhost:8080/v1alpha2/solution/instances?name=redis-instance

    * Body: Same as above. 
    
    > **NOTE**: Symphony requires the deployment object to be posted during deletion because it aims to make providers stateless. The state is played back to the provider to make decisions.
