# Workflows

Symphony supports complex deployment processes that are represented by a workflow, which is called a *campaign* in Symphony.

For more information about workflows, see [Workflows](../concepts/workflows.md). Or, learn more about the specific implementation with the following topics:

* [Campaigns](./campaign.md)
* [Campaign Scenarios](./campaign-scenarios.md)
