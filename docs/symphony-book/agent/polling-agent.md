# Symphony Polling Agent (Piccolo)

_(last edit: 9/18/2023)_

Piccolo is a lightweight Symphony agent that can be installed on tiny edge devices. Itâ€™s about 4MB in size and requires about 430K memory at runtime. It connects back to Symphony control plane with an outbound HTTP/HTTPS connection and reconciles device state with the desired state from the control plane.

Piccolo is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
