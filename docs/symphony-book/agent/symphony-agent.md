# Symphony Agent

A Symphony Agent runs on a ```Target``` and provides several services to Symphony payloads running on the same target, including:
* Get object references from the control plane.
* Probe and report health of associated ```Device```s.
* Capture and upload camera images for camera ```Device```s.

A Symphony Agent is a microservice that exposes a HTTP endpoint to Symphony payloads. We offer a Symphony container (```possprod.azurecr.io/symphony-agent```) as well as cross-platform binary that can be configured as a system daemon or service.
## Prepare for Symphony Agent deployment
1. Symphony Agent needs a Service Principal to access an Azure Storage Account to upload camera snapshots. In current version, we support Service Principal with a secret. Please see instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authentication-service-principal?tabs=azure-cli#service-principal-secret) to create a new Service Principal.
    ```bash
    # create resource group
    az group create --name <resource group name> --location <location> 
    # create key vault
    az keyvault create --location <location> --name <key vault name> --resource-group <resource group name>
    # create service principal
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <service principal name> --role Contributor --scope /subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourceGroups/<resource group name>
    ```
    Make sure you've copied the ```password``` output before closing your terminal window. 

    > **NOTE:** we'll support certificate-based principals in future versions.
2. If needed, create an Azure Storage account and a container for storing the snapshots:
    ```bash
    az storage account create --name <storage account name> --resource-group <resource group name> --location <location> --sku Standard_LRS
    az storage container create -n snapshots --account-name <storage account name>
    ```
3. If you plan to run Symphony Agent as a process or a service, you need to install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) on your target machine. You can skip this step if you plan to run Symphony Agent as a container, which has FFmpeg pre-installed.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    # verify installation
    ffmpeg -version
    ```
## Option 1: Run Symphony Agent as a container
To test Symphony Agent on your local dev machine, you can use the prebuilt container:

```bash
docker run -p 8088:8088 -e SYMPHONY_URL=http://<Symphony control plane endpoint>:8080/v1alpha2/agent/references -e AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<service principal app id> -e AZURE_TENANT_ID=<service principal tenant id> -e AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<service principal client secret> -e STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<storage account name> -e STORAGE_CONTAINER=<storage container name> -e TARGET_NAME=<target name> hbai/symphony-agent:0.1.26
```
Where `<Symphony control plane endpoint>` is the DNS/IP of Symphony control plane endpoint. For example, when you run Symphony control plane on a Kubernetes cluster, the control plane exposes a load-balanced service endpoint for agents. You can get the service endpoint with:
```bash
kubectl get svc symphony-service-ext #use returned EXTERNAL-IP to connect
```

## Option 2: Run Symphony Agent as a process
To run Symphony Agent as a process, you need to set required environment variables first, and then launch the agent:
```bash
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<service principal app id>
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<service principal tenant id>
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<service principal client secret>
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<storage account name>
export STORAGE_CONTAINER=<storage container name>
export SYMPHONY_URL=http://<symphony API address>:8080/v1alpha2/agent/references # point to your local Symphony API endpoint, or the public Symphony API service ednpoint on K8s
export TARGET_NAME=<target name> #the name of the Target object representing the current compute device

./symphony-agent -c ./symphony-agent.json -l Debug
```


## Get object reference
You can get Symphony object specs, such as AI ```Skill``` and ```Solution```, through the Symphony agent:

**Route**: ```http://<Symphony agent endpoint>:8088/v1alpha2/agent/references```
**Method**: GET
**Parameters**:
|parameter|comment|
|--------|--------|
|alias | AI Skill alias<sup>1</sup>|
|field-selector|field selector (optional), for example: ```metadata.name=redis-server```|
|group|resource group, like ```ai.symphony```, ```solution.symphony``` and ```fabric.symphony```|
|id| resource name (optional)|
|instance| solution instance id<sup>1</sup>|
|kind|resource kind, like ```skills```, ```solutions``` and ```devices```|
|label-selector| label selector (optional), for example: ```foo=bar```|
|ref|reference provider type. Use ```v1alpha2.ReferenceK8sCRD``` to query K8s objects |
|scope|namespace, like ```default```|
|version|resource version, like ```v1```|

**<sup>1</sup>**: This parameter is supposed to be used in ```skill``` queries only. When supplied, ```skill``` parameter values will be overriden by corresponding values (named as ```<skill name>.<parameter name>```) in the ```instance``` object. In addition, if the ```alias``` parameter is specified, Symphony uses ```<skill name>.<alias>.<parameter name>``` to locate instance overrides instead. Please see [parameter management](../ai-management/parameter-management.md) for more details.

And the reference endpoint can also be used to resovle Azure Custom Vision model download URLs. Some addition parameters are used for such queries:

|parameter|comment|
|--------|--------|
|flavor| Custom Vision model export flavor (such as ```TensorFlowNormal```)|
|lookup|set to ```download``` when querying download URLs|
|iteration | Custom Model iteration |
|platform| Custom Vision model export platform (such as ```TensorFlow```)|
> **NOTE** if ```flavor``` and ```platform``` are omitted, the reference endpoint only returns existing exports. If both are provided, the reference endpoint will request a new export if necessary (such as when existing exports have expired).


**Examples**

* Get AI Skill with name ```cv-model```:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:8088/v1alpha2/agent/references?scope=default&kind=skills&version=v1&group=ai.symphony&id=cv-model&&ref=v1alpha2.ReferenceK8sCRD
  ```
* List AI Skill with label ```foo=bar```:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:8088/v1alpha2/agent/references?scope=default&kind=skills&version=v1&group=ai.symphony&label-selector=foo=bar&&ref=v1alpha2.ReferenceK8sCRD
  ```
* Get AI Skill with name ```sv-skill```, overwrite its parameters with values in instance ```dummy-instance```, aliased as ```abc``` (see [parameter management](../ai-management/parameter-management.md) for more details):
  ```bash
  http://localhost:8088/v1alpha2/agent/references?scope=default&kind=skills&version=v1&group=ai.symphony&id=cv-skill&ref=v1alpha2.ReferenceK8sCRD&instance=dummy-instance&alias=abc
  ```
## Report object state
You can report object state through Symphony Agent
**Route**: ```http://<Symphony agent endpoint>:8088/v1alpha2/agent/references```
**Method**: POST
**Parameters**:
|parameter|comment|
|--------|--------|
|group|resource group, like ```ai.symphony```, ```solution.symphony``` and ```fabric.symphony```|
|id| resource name (optional)|
|kind|resource kind, like ```skills```, ```solutions``` and ```devices```|
|overwrite| if set to true, the object state will be reset to reported properties. Otherwise, the reported properties are merged into existing state (optional, default = false) |
|scope|namespace, like ```default```|
|version|resource version, like ```v1```|
**Body**: A key-value pair collection of reported properties

>**NOTE:** Symphony always reports object state as a key-value collection named ```properties```.

## Capture camera frame
Capturing camera frames happens automatically, and captured image URL will be reported as part of ```device``` state as a ```snapshot``` property.
