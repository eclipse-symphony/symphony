# Symphony Concepts

Symphony operates within an orchestration layer, strategically positioned atop preexisting tools and services. To establish uniformity amidst the diverse edge environment, Symphony relies on a set of fundamental high-level abstractions. These encompass state-seeking, graph, workflow, and app models. These foundational abstractions empower Symphony to deliver robust functionalities across various technologies and platforms while maintaining an exceedingly concise object model.
