# Federation

Symphony federation extends Symphony from a single-site system into a multi-site system that can manage multiple physical sites (represented by Symphony site installations) from a central place (represented by a Symphony HQ installation). Symphony federation offers:

* End-to-end observability across multiple physical sites.
* Centralized solutions, configurations, and policies management.
* Centralized artifact management.
