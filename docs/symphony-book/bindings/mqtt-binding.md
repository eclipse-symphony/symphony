# MQTT Binding

MQTT binding allows you to access Symphony API, standalone providers, as well as Symphony Agent through [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/). Given many enterprises allow MQTT protocol for IoT payloads, the MQTT binding allows Symphony API to be used without extra firewall settings.

## Setting up a MQTT broker
You can use any standard MQTT broker, either cloud-based or locally hosted. This section provides a couple of options using [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).

> **NOTE:** At the time of writing, Symphony MQTT implementation doesn't support authentication, so anonymous access is required.

### Run Eclipse Mosquitto for local tests

1. Create a file called `mosquitto.conf` with the following content:

   ```bash
   persistence false
   allow_anonymous true
   connection_messages true
   log_type all
   listener 1883
   ```

   > **NOTE:** You can find a copy of this file under [docs/samples/mqtt-binding/mosquitto.conf](../../samples/mqtt-binding/mosquitto.conf)

2. Launch Mosquitto with Docker

   ```bash
   docker run --name mosquitto -d -p 1883:1883 --rm -v `pwd`/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf eclipse-mosquitto
   ```

### Run Eclipse Mosquitto on K8s

You can find a sample deployment spec under [docs/samples/mqtt-binding/k8s.yaml](../../samples/mqtt-binding/k8s.yaml). Apply the k8s deployment spec to your kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl create -f ./k8s.yaml
```

## Configure MQTT binding

> **NOTE:** At the time of writing, MQTT binding doesn't support middleware yet.

To use MQTT binding, define your binding in your [Symphony host configuration file](../hosts/_overview.md):

```json
"bindings": [
  {
    "type": "bindings.mqtt",
    "config": {
      "brokerAddress": "tcp://<IP of your MQTT broker>:1883",
      "clientID": "<Client ID of your choice",
      "requestTopic": "coa-request",
      "responseTopic": "coa-response"
    }
  }
]
```

The topics `coa-request` and `coa-response` should match with what [MQTT proxy provider](../providers/mqtt_proxy_provider.md) uses when you connect to the proxy provider.
