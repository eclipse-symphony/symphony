# Serving Configurations
Configuration can be injected into Solution components as environment variables or file mounts (on Kubernetes). An application can also query Symphony REST API to retrieve configurations.

## Configuration in Environment Variables

A Solution component can inject configuration settings as environment variables by defining properties with an "```env.```" prefix. For example, the following definition injects a ```MY_CONFIG``` environment variable into the app-container component. And the value is a ```config-key``` field from a ```config-obj``` Catalog.

```yaml
apiVersion: solution.symphony/v1
kind: Solution
metadata: 
  name: csad-featurizer
spec:  
  components:
  - name: app-container
    type: container
    properties:
      container.image: "possprod.azurecr.io/sample-flask-app:latest"      
      env.MY_CONFIG: "$config(config-obj, config-key)" 
```
## Configuration as a mounted file
When deploying applications on Kubernetes, Symphony can assemble a configuration file and mount the file to a pod. To do this, youâ€™ll need to declare a configuration component, and then a container component that has the configuration component as a dependency, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: solution.symphony/v1
kind: Solution
metadata: 
  name: my-app
spec:  
  components:
  - name: app-config
    type: config
    properties:
      appSettings.json: "$json($config('<config-obj>', ''))"
  - name: app
    type: container
    metadata:
      pod.volumes: "[{\"name\":\"app-config\",\"configMap\":{\"name\":\"app-config\"}}]" 
    properties:
      container.image: "possprod.azurecr.io/sample-flask-app:latest"      
      container.volumeMounts: "[{\"name\":\"app-config\",\"mountPath\":\"/app/config\"}]"
    dependencies:
    - app-config
```
What happens behind the scenes during the deployment:
1.	Symphony creates a Kubernetes ConfigMap named ```app-config```. The ConfigMap contains an ```appSettings.json``` file, whose content is populated from a ```config-obj``` Catalog object.
2.	Symphony creates a pod volume and a volume mount at path ```/app/config``` for the app container.
