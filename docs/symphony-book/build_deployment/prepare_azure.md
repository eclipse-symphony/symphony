# Prepare Azure resources

Symphony doesn't have dependencies on Azure resources. However, to run through sample scenarios and demos, you need to create a few Azure resources to support Azure IoT Hub scenarios.

> **NOTE:** All instructions below are provided as Azure CLI commands. Use Azure Cloud Shell if you don't have the CLI installed locally. We assume you've already logged in (az login).

## 1. Create a resource group

We require some standard tier and premium tier offers, so the testing wonâ€™t be free. We recommend keeping all of your demo resources under the same resource group so that you can easily clean up your environment once you are done.

```bash
az group create -l <location> -n <resource group name>
#NOTE: Choose a location where all services are available, such as westus2.
```

## 2. Create an IoT Hub

```bash
az iot hub create --resource-group <resource group name> --name <IoT Hub name> --sku S1 --partition-count 2
```

> **NOTE:** The test scenarios require a standard tier (S1, S2 or S3) version of IoT Hub. You can choose a different --partition-count as desired (default is 4). For lite tests a single partition may be sufficient.

## 3. Create an IoT Edge device

Symphony can acts both as a control plane and a deployment target (we call target). When it's used as a target, it corresponds to an IoT Edge device, when IoT Edge modules are used.

```bash
az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name <Iot Hub name> --device-id <device id> --edge-enabled
```

> **NOTE:** In most sample scenarios, we'll use Symphony as both the control plane and the target.

## Next steps

Now that you have your Azure resources in place, create a Kubernetes cluster with one of the following options:

* [AKS](./aks.md)
* [Kind](./kind.md)
* [MicroK8s](./microk8s.md)
* [K3s](./k3s.md)
