# Deploy Symphony Behind API Management Service

It may be preferable to deploy Symphony API behind an [API Management Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/api-management) for static IP and domain names, automatic certificate binding, and monitoring.

You can use the [OpenAPI V3 Yaml](../api/symphony-api-openapi.yaml) to help you to create APIM configuration.
