# Scenario: Updating a MIMXRT1170-EVK Board

_(last update: 2/24/2024)_

This tutorial walks you the steps of setting up a [MIMXRT1170-EVK board](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-rt1170-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT1170-EVK) and using a PowerShell script provider to update the board. For simplicity, this tutorial assumes you have MCUXpresso IDE installed and configured (see instruction link below). The tutorial also assumes the board is attached via USB to the PC where the script provider runs. In a production environment, you may want to consider to use other tools like [PyOCD](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD) and configure your PC `Target` so that required toolchain is installed.

## Preparation

1. Follow [Getting Started with the i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit](https://www.nxp.com/document/guide/getting-started-with-the-i-mx-rt1170-evaluation-kit:GS-MIMXRT1170-EVK) to configure your MIMXRT1170-EVK board. Make sure you download and install the device driver (while the board is connected to your PC via USB and powered on).
2. Get a serial terminal tool like [Putty](https://putty.org/).

## Build SDK samples (with MCUXpresso IDE)

1. In the **Quickstart Panel**, select **Import SDK example(s)...**
2. Select the **evkmimx1170** board and click the **Next** button.
3. Browse and select samples, such as:
    * multicore_examples/hello_word.cm7 (Displays a 'hello world' message on Terminal and a blinking LED on the board)
    * demo_apps/bubble_peripheral_cm7 (Streams accelerator readings to a Terminal)
4. Build the projects.
5. For each of the projects you want to use, under the sample project root folder, click on the `*.launch` file to open launching profile.
6. Go to the **GUI Flash Tool** tab, check the **Preview command** checkbox, and then click on the **Run...** button.
7. On the command preview window, copy the content in the **Command to use in a script** box and save it as a batch file, such as `hello_world.cmd` and `bubble_peripheral.cmd`. This is the script you'll call to deploy the application.
