# Configuration Management Documentation

This directory contains resources and guidelines for managing various degrees of configuration complexity.  It includes examples and instructions for the following scenarios.  Each scenario is a self-contained example, deployable to an existing Kubernetes cluster.

* [Conditional Configuration Activation](./conditional-activation/README.md): This section provides guidance on enabling or disabling specific configuration sections based on a predetermined flag. It explains how to conditionally include sections in the final configuration object, ensuring that only relevant configurations are applied.

* [Reusable Configuration Segments](./reusable-segments/README.md): This part focuses on the modularization of configuration elements. It demonstrates how to isolate commonly used configuration sections into separate objects for easy inclusion across multiple deployments, such as different lines, sites, or regions. This approach simplifies configuration management by promoting reusability.

* [Array Merging in Configurations](./array-merging/README.md): Here, we address the management of configurations that contain extensive lists, such as 50+ tags, which may vary slightly by location but share a core set. The documentation outlines a method for separating the common elements into a single configuration object and merging them with unique sets specific to each site or region. This technique is particularly useful for streamlining the configuration process and ensuring consistency across different locations.
