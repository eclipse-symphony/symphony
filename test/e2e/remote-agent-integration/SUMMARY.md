# Symphony Remote Agent E2E Test Suite - Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive end-to-end test suite for your Symphony remote agent integration. The test suite covers both HTTP and MQTT communication protocols and validates the complete workflow from Symphony K8s server startup to data interaction between server and agent.

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. HTTP Communication Tests (`scenarios/http-communication/http_test.go`)
- **Target Resource Management**: Creates and manages Symphony Target resources
- **Remote Agent Startup**: Starts remote agent with HTTP configuration
- **Topology Update Verification**: Validates topology updates via HTTP endpoints
- **Data Interaction Testing**: Tests end-to-end workflow with Instance resources
- **Certificate-based Authentication**: Uses TLS certificates for secure communication

#### 2. MQTT Communication Tests (`scenarios/mqtt-communication/mqtt_test.go`)
- **MQTT Broker Setup**: Automatically starts containerized Eclipse Mosquitto broker with TLS
- **Critical Timing**: Applies Target YAML first so Symphony server subscribes to topics
- **Certificate Authentication**: Tests both valid and invalid certificate scenarios
- **Bi-directional Communication**: Validates `symphony/request/{target}` and `symphony/response/{target}` topics
- **Connection Resilience**: Tests reconnection behavior
- **Topic Verification**: Ensures proper MQTT topic subscription

#### 3. Utilities (`utils/`)
- **Certificate Generation** (`cert_utils.go`): Self-signed CA, server, and client certificates
- **Test Helpers** (`test_helpers.go`): Kubernetes resource management, process control
- **MQTT Utilities** (`mqtt_utils.go`): Docker-based MQTT broker management

#### 4. Test Infrastructure
- **Automatic Cleanup**: All resources are automatically cleaned up after tests
- **Temporary Directories**: Test files are created in temporary directories
- **Process Management**: Remote agent processes are properly managed and terminated
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting

## Test Scenarios Covered

### HTTP Communication Flow
1. **Symphony Server** (assumed running) ← You mentioned this exposes ports
2. **Target Resource Creation** → Creates Target in Kubernetes
3. **Remote Agent Startup** → Connects via HTTP to Symphony endpoints
4. **Topology Update** → Agent calls `/targets/updatetopology/{targetName}`
5. **Data Interaction** → Creates Instance, validates end-to-end processing

### MQTT Communication Flow  
1. **MQTT Broker Startup** → Docker container with TLS configuration
2. **Symphony Server** (assumed running) 
3. **Target Resource Creation** → **CRITICAL**: Server subscribes to `symphony/request/{target}`
4. **Remote Agent Startup** → Connects to MQTT broker with client certificates
5. **Topology Update** → Agent publishes topology via MQTT topic
6. **Data Interaction** → Bi-directional MQTT communication testing

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Correct MQTT Timing
- **Problem Solved**: You mentioned that Symphony server needs to see Target first to subscribe to topics
- **Solution**: Tests apply Target YAML before starting remote agent
- **Verification**: Tests wait for Target creation and give time for topic subscription

### 2. Certificate Management
- **Self-signed Certificates**: No need for cloud-based certificates
- **Automatic Generation**: CA, server, and client certificates generated per test
- **TLS Security**: Full TLS authentication for both HTTP and MQTT

### 3. Docker-based MQTT Broker
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Uses containerized Eclipse Mosquitto
- **TLS Configuration**: Proper certificate setup for secure MQTT
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Containers are automatically stopped and removed

### 4. Process vs Service Management
- **Direct Process Control**: Uses `go run` instead of systemd services
- **Better for Testing**: Easier to control, debug, and clean up
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start (Windows)
```cmd
cd test/e2e/remote-agent-integration
run_tests.bat -t http -v
run_tests.bat -t mqtt -v
```

### Quick Start (Linux/macOS)
```bash
cd test/e2e/remote-agent-integration
./run_tests.sh -t http -v
./run_tests.sh -t mqtt -v
```

### Using Make
```bash
make test-http      # HTTP tests only
make test-mqtt      # MQTT tests only
make test           # All tests
```

### Direct Go Commands
```bash
go test -v ./scenarios/http-communication/
go test -v ./scenarios/mqtt-communication/
```

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Go 1.21+
- Docker (for MQTT tests)
- kubectl (configured with Kubernetes access)
- Kubernetes cluster with Symphony CRDs

### Optional
- mosquitto-clients (for MQTT connection verification)

## Test Environment

### Automatic Setup
- **Certificates**: Generated automatically for each test
- **MQTT Broker**: Started in Docker container with TLS
- **Namespaces**: Test-specific Kubernetes namespaces
- **Cleanup**: All resources automatically cleaned up

### Configuration
- **HTTP URL**: `https://localhost:8443/v1alpha2` (configurable)
- **MQTT Ports**: 1883 (plain), 8883 (TLS)
- **Topics**: `symphony/request/{target}`, `symphony/response/{target}`
- **Timeouts**: Configurable per test type

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Start Symphony Server
The tests assume Symphony K8s server is running. You can:
- Start it manually before running tests
- Modify the TODO comments in tests to start it automatically

### 2. Install Symphony CRDs
Ensure your Kubernetes cluster has Symphony CRDs installed:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/config/
```

### 3. Run Tests
Choose your preferred method from the options above.

## Extending the Tests

### Adding New Scenarios
1. Create new test functions in existing files
2. Follow the established patterns for setup/cleanup
3. Use the utility functions for common operations

### Customizing Configuration
- Edit test files to change URLs, ports, timeouts
- Set environment variables for different configurations
- Modify certificate generation for different scenarios

## Benefits of This Test Suite

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- Both HTTP and MQTT protocols
- Certificate authentication
- End-to-end data flow
- Error scenarios

### 2. Realistic Testing
- Uses actual Docker containers
- Real Kubernetes resources
- Proper TLS certificates
- Correct timing sequences

### 3. Developer Friendly

- Cross-platform support

### 4. CI/CD Ready
- Scriptable execution
- Timeout management
- Exit codes for automation
- Coverage reporting

This test suite provides you with a robust foundation for validating your Symphony remote agent integration across both HTTP and MQTT communication protocols.
