# Overview

This is a framework for symphony fault tests. 

# How to add a new fault test
1. Add failpoints in codes

Add a comment line like example blow. Gofail package will translate it to the failpoint code when compiled with failpoint enabled.
```
// DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT
// gofail: var beforeProviders string
```

2. Add a new fault test case

There are already two fault tests - solution upgrade and workflow materialize in the faultTests folder. You can add a new case in the [constants.go](./utils/constants.go) you want to use existing fault tests with new failpoint.

For example, you can specify the test, the pod to inject failure, the failpoint name and fault types in the below structure. The most common fault type is `100.0%panic`. And you can also use other faults like sleep, error following [Gofail term](https://github.com/etcd-io/gofail/blob/master/doc/design.md#gofail-term)
```json
{
    testCase:  TestCases["solutionUpdate"],
    podLabel:  PodLabels["api"],
    fault:     "onQueueError",
    faultType: DefaultFaultType,
}
```

You can also add new fault tests under faultTests if the existing ones don't hit the new failpoints.

# Run tests

## Local
First build fault images and setup cluster 
```
cd test/localenv
mage build:apifault
mage build:k8sfault
mage cluster:up
```
Trigger fault test.
```
cd test/integration/scenarios/faultTests
mage faulttests
```

## Github Action

Here is a fault [github action](../../../../.github/workflows/fault.yml) and you can trigger the workflow in the Action page.

# Diagnostic

## Local
All the test logs are collected under `/tmp/symphony-integration-test-logs/`

## Github Action
All the test logs are collected in the artifacts
