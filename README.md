### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ This branch hosts experimental features. The Symphony community does not guarantee long-term support for these features. Their incorporation into the main branch is not assured, and they may be deprecated or removed at any time without notice. For more details, please see [Experimental Feature Table](./experimental-features.md)⚠️⚠️⚠️



Symphony is a powerful service orchestration engine that enables the organization of multiple intelligent edge services into a seamless, end-to-end experience. Its primary purpose is to address the inherent complexity of edge deployment by providing a set of technology-agnostic workflow APIs, which are designed to deliver a streamlined experience for users across all device profiles.

Symphony is uniquely capable of providing consistency across the entire software stack, from drivers to containers to configurations and policies. This comprehensive approach ensures that all aspects of your intelligent edge projects are effectively managed and optimized. Moreover, Symphony provides full support for the entire lifecycle of your edge computing initiatives, spanning from the initial deployment to ongoing updates and maintenance.

With Symphony, users can benefit from a powerful and versatile platform that streamlines edge service orchestration and management, while also ensuring seamless integration with existing technology stacks. Whether you are a small business owner or a large enterprise, Symphony is an ideal solution for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of your edge computing initiatives.

## Symphony Characteristics

* Standard-based

    Symphony is a versatile and standards-based solution that delivers exceptional flexibility and extensibility. It natively runs on Kubernetes, which means users can leverage all existing Kubernetes tooling to interact with Symphony. Moreover, Symphony supports a wide range of popular industrial standards, protocols, and frameworks, including [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), [Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)](https://dapr.io/), [Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)](https://mqtt.org/), [Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://onnx.ai/), [Akri](https://github.com/project-akri/akri), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and many others. This broad range of support makes Symphony an ideal solution for organizations seeking to build and deploy edge services that meet their specific needs.

    Symphony also supports running in a standalone mode independent from Kubernetes. All you need is a single Symphony binary and nothing else!

* Meet customers where they are

    Another key advantage of Symphony is its extensibility. It supports the integration of first-party and third-party services, and all Symphony capabilities, including device registry, device updates, and solution deployment, can be replaced with custom implementations. This means that Symphony can be tailored to meet the specific needs of any organization, regardless of their size or complexity.

* Zero-friction adoption

    Symphony's zero-friction adoption approach is another key feature that sets it apart from other solutions. Users can get started with Symphony using a single computer, and there is no need for special hardware, an Azure subscription, or Kubernetes to start experimenting with the solution. Additionally, the same Symphony artifacts used during testing and development can be carried over into production deployments, ensuring a smooth transition and reducing overall deployment time and costs.

- **Symphony is platform agnostic**

    Symphony was started by Microsoft as a platform-agnostic project, making it an ideal solution for organizations that already use Azure Edge and AI services like [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/), [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-edge/), [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/), [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/category/storage/), [Azure ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/), [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/), and [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview). However, Symphony is also fully compatible with other non-Azure services or open-source software tools, allowing organizations to modify the solution to meet their specific needs. This flexibility ensures that Symphony meets customers where they are, making it an ideal solution for organizations of all sizes and complexities.

## Getting Started
There are several ways to get started with Symphony, including using the CLI tool, Helm, Docker, or the symphony-api binary.

### Using Symphony CLI

> **NOTE**: The following GitHub URL is a temporary parking location and is sugject to change.

The easiest way to get started with Symphony is by using Symphony's CLI tool, called maestro. The CLI tool can be installed on **Linux**, **WSL**, and **Mac** using the following command:

```Bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-symphony/symphony/experimental/cli/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash
```
For **Windows**, the following PowerShell command can be used:
```PowerShell
powershell -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-symphony/symphony/experimental/cli/install/install.ps1 | iex"
```
After Symphony is installed, you can use `maestro` to try out sample scenarios.

```bash
maestro up
```

### Using Helm
You can also install Symphony using Helm by running the following command:
```Bash
helm install symphony oci://ghcr.io/eclipse-symphony/helm/symphony --version '0.48.28'
```
After Symphony is installed, you can use maestro to try out sample scenarios.

### Using Docker
You can also install Symphony using Docker with the bundled `symphony-api.json` or volume mounting your own & injecting its reference via `CONFIG` env:
```Bash
docker run -d --name symphony-api -p 8080:8080 -e CONFIG=/symphony-api.json ghcr.io/eclipse-symphony/symphony-api:0.48.28
```
### Using symphony-api binary
You can also run Symphony in standalone mode as a single process by running the following command:
```Bash
./symphony-api -c ./symphony-api-dev.json -l Debug
```
## Provider Conformance Test Results
Symphony is an extensible system with the concept of providers. For each provider types, we define one or multiple conformance test suites that ensure provider implementations behaves consistently and predictably.

### Target Providers
