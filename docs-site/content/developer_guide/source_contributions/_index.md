Symphony's source code is primarily written in [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install). It also includes [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for Rust-based providers and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for the sample portal. Some Symphony samples use a mix of other languages, including [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), C and [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). If you're developing a new Symphony provider, we recommend using Rust.
