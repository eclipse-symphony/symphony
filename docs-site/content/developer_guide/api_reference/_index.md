Symphony defines two sets of APIs - a server-side API and a target-side API. The server-side API is comprised by a group of indepdent microservices, and the target-side API defines the interfaces an optional remote agent need to implement to participate in the overall state-seeking or campaign. 

# Server-side API

Among the server-side microservices is a group of REST style microservices that offer CRUD operations on key Symphony types like Instances, Solutions, and Targets. There are also other microservices for authentication, federation, multi-site management, and integration with various systems through Hydra.

# Target-side API

Target API defines the interfaces a remote agent needs to implement in order to particpate Symphony state-seeking process or campaign workflows.
