# Postman Collections for Symphony and Bluefin
This directory houses the postman collections for Symphony and Bluefin.

The postman collections mainly host Resource Provider operations that are being used to register the resource provider, resource types, as well as sample CRUD operations on these resource types for testing. These collections are mainly targeted at RPaaS' PrivateRP environment but will eventually be migrated to the private preview environment.

To use these collections please log into your own personal postman account and import them there.
